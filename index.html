<h2>Summary</h2>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I went to De La Salle secondary school in Dundalk where I found my passion
    for computer science as I went to CITCO and CISCO in Dublin on my two work experience
    oppourtunities. I then took computer science for my leaving certificate of which
    I received 89% in.
